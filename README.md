* User and administrator enumeration
* Process listing and process tree
* Network artifacts:

  * netstat (including established connections)
  * ARP table
  * DNS cache
  * Hosts file
* Persistence checks:

  * Run keys
  * Services
  * Scheduled tasks
  * Startup folders
* WMI persistence detection
* Installed software inventory
* Event log collection (Security, System, PowerShell)
* PowerShell command history collection
* User activity (recent files)
* Environment variables collection
* Full `C:\` file listing

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Windows 10 / 11 / Server
* PowerShell 5+ or 7
* Administrator privileges

**Optional:**

* osquery installed and added to PATH

## 📂 Output

The script generates a timestamped directory:

```
DFIR_Output_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS
```

Each file includes:

* Command executed
* Timestamp
* Raw command output

Additionally:

* 📦 A compressed archive (`.zip`) of the output is created
* 🔐 SHA256 hashes of collected files are generated for integrity

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

* Full `C:\` recursive listing may take significant time depending on disk size
* Output files can be large (especially file listings)
* Ensure sufficient disk space before execution
* Designed for **triage collection**, not full forensic imaging
* Some commands may require specific system permissions
* Event logs are limited to recent entries for performance

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

* Incident Response (IR)
* Threat Hunting
* Live Response Collection
* Malware Investigations

---

## 🔍 Investigation Tips (DFIR Insight)

* Review `netstat_established.txt` for suspicious outbound connections
* Correlate `process_tree.txt` with unusual parent-child relationships
* Inspect `runkey_*`, `startup_*`, and `scheduled_tasks.txt` for persistence
* Analyze WMI artifacts for stealth persistence mechanisms
* Check `dns_cache.txt` and `hosts_file.txt` for suspicious domains
* Review `powershell_history.txt` for attacker commands
* Investigate `eventlog_security.txt` for login activity
